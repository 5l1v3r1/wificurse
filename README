This program listens for beacons send from wireless access points
in the range of your wireless station. Once received the program
extracts the BSSID of the AP and transmits deauthentication packages
using the broadcast MAC address. This results to the disconnection
of all clients connected at the AP at the time of the attack. This
is essencially a WiFi DoS attack tool created for educational
purposes only. It works only in Linux and requires wireless card
drivers capable of injecting packets in wireless networks.

If your Linux kernel is version 2.6.35 or above, you have to
apply the patch patches/cfg80211_monitor_mode_channel_fix.patch
to the kernel.

How to use it: Just run it as root and put as first argument the
card interface. It will automatically put your interface in monitor
mode and it will listen at channel range 1-14. If there is no AP in the
channel, it will change channel every 1 second, or else it will start
the attack which it takes approximately 30 seconds. After that it will
change channel.
